  {"text": "P Wave\nThe first upwards peak is called the P wave and is caused by the heart's “pacemaker”, the sinoatrial (SA) node, sending a signal to the upper chambers of the heart (the atria) to contract. \nPR Segment\nFollowing the P wave there’s a pause (the PR segment) before the atrioventricular (AV) node reacts and fires the signal to the lower chambers (ventricles) which is observed as the Q wave. \nQRS Complex\nIn response to the AV node, as the signal travels through the ventricles, we first observe the R wave followed by the S wave as the ventricles contract and pump blood into the body and lungs (these are the biggest peaks and valleys because pumping blood to the body takes more energy than pumping it around the heart).\nST Segment \nFinally, there’s a pause in electrical activity called the ST segment which should be a flat line at the baseline 0 mV followed by the T wave as the heart resets for the next sinus pattern to begin."}
