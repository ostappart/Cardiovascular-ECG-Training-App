    <string name="aboutInformation">
        This ECG training app is designed specifically for Indian
        Volunteer healthcare workers (ASHAs). It contains training lessons on the basics
        of reading ECGs tailored for ASHAs, and includes practice questions with
        progress updates. Through user testing, the design and lessons are meant to be
        simple and easy to navigate.

        \n\nMobile ECG devices make it possible to perform community screening for heart conditions.
        When these screenings are performed by front line health workers, it is necessary to provide
        some basic health training to the workers to help them explain the results to patients.

        \n\nCreated as part of a capstone project for CSE482B at the University of Washington.
